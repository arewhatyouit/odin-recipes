    <h1>Apple Crisp</h1>
    <img src="/images/apple-crisp.jpg">
    <p>This is an easy to make fried rice using fresh veggies, ginger, garlic and sesame oil. This can be made with vegetables you already have in the fridge or fresh from the farmer's market. Add chicken or tofu for some extra protein.</p>

    <h3>Apple Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5lb bag of granny smith apples</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Topping Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Chop all your apples and combine in a large bowl with the coconut sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Pour apples into a pyrex baking pan large enough so they all go below the edge.</li>
        <li>In the same large bowl as the apples - don't bother washing it - mix together all the dry ingredients for the topping. Once mixed add softened butter and knead with your hands until the topping is homogenous.</li>
        <li>Pour topping over the apples and press down into all the nooks and crannies.</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 45 to 50 minutes, until the top is a golden brown and the liquid starts bubbling around the edges.</li>
        <li>Let cool and serve warm with vanilla icecream.</li>
        
    </ol>
